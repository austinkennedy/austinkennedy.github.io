## About

Welcome to my website! My name is Austin Kennedy, I am an economist at NRG Energy working on the most challenging problems at the frontier of the energy industry. I received my PhD from University of Coloradoâ€“Boulder in 2024 and have expertise in experimentation (A/B Testing), causal inference, machine learning, and generative AI. I have performed academic research on international finance, culture, and technology, with a publication in the *Journal of International Money and Finance* and an R&R at the *Quarterly Journal of Economics*.

I am passionate about driving high-value decision making using data combined with expert research design and analysis. My work at NRG has informed high-stakes decisions ranging from energy trading strategy, Generative AI implementation, and real-time power plant operations.

I previously interned as an economist for Amazon during Summer 2023, where I worked on a project to estimate downstream impacts in a murky empirical environment and delivered informative and impactful results to business stakeholders. At Amazon I found my passion for leveraging detailed data combined with cutting-edge statistical tools to drive evidence-based decision making.

As a native Coloradoan, I enjoy spending time in the great outdoors with my wife and dog via hiking and skiing. I am in an endless pursuit for the perfect cup of coffee and enjoy trying coffee from a variety of roasters. I also follow meteorology as a hobbyist and have occasionally tried my hand at (cautiously) storm chasing!
