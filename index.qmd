## About

Welcome to my website! My name is Austin Kennedy, I am an economics PhD graduate from the University of Colorado--Boulder with research on the intersection between development, international finance, culture, and technology.

I am an expert in causal inference and applied econometrics with a passion for applying economics and causal inference tools to real-world problems to develop data-driven solutions. I am a perpetual learner with additional expertise in machine-learning and online experimentation.

I previously interned as an economist for Amazon during Summer 2023, where I worked on a project to estimate downstream impacts in a murky empirical environment and delivered informative and impactful results to business stakeholders. At Amazon I found my passion for leveraging detailed data combined with cutting-edge statistical tools to drive evidence-based decision making.

As a native Coloradoan, I enjoy spending time in the great outdoors with my wife and dog via hiking and skiing. I am in an endless pursuit for the perfect cup of coffee and enjoy trying coffee from a variety of roasters. I also follow meteorology as a hobbyist and have occasionally tried my hand at (cautiously) storm chasing!
