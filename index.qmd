## About

Welcome to my website! My name is Austin Kennedy, I am an economics PhD candidate at the University of Colorado--Boulder researching the intersection between development, international finance, culture, and technology.

I am an expert in causal inference and applied econometrics with a passion for applying economics and causal inference tools to real-world problems to develop data-driven solutions. I am a perpetual learner hoping to deepen my experience in causal machine learning and big data. 

I previously interned as an economist for Amazon during Summer 2023, where I worked on a project to estimate downstream impacts in a murky empirical environment and delivered informative and impactful results to business stakeholders.
