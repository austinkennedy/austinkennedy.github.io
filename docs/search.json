    "text": "Enlightenment Ideals and Belief in Science in the Run-up to the Industrial Revolution: A Textual Analysis with Ali Almelhem, Murat Iyigun, and Jared Rubin\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nUsing textual analysis of 173,031 works printed in England between 1500 and 1900, we test whether British culture evolved to manifest a heightened belief in progress associated with science and industry. Our analysis yields three main findings. First, there was a separation in the language of science and religion beginning in the 17th century. Second, scientific volumes became more progress-oriented during the Enlightenment. Third, industrial works, especially those at the science-political economy nexus, were more progress-oriented beginning in the 17th century. It was therefore the more pragmatic, industrial works which reflected the cultural values cited as important for Britain’s takeoff."

This paper investigates fiscal spillovers out of the United States following the first round of direct fiscal stimulus in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, through a previously unexplored informal financial channel: cryptocurrency. Using transaction-level cryptocurrency data and an algorithm to discover cross-border cryptocurrency transactions, this paper documents significant international financial outflows from the US through cryptocurrency, with a large majority of flows destined for low- and lower-middle income countries. Interestingly, using a difference-in-differences methodology, this paper finds no evidence that cryptocurrency outflows from the US increased relative to those from other countries in response to the stimulus checks.\n\n\nDoes Business Culture Travel? The Case of Worker Safety.\n\n\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper investigates the effect of foreign direct investment (FDI) into the US on workplace safety outcomes, as well as heterogeneity by source country and source country workplace safety outcomes. This paper utilizes detailed, plant-level panel data on workplace injuries and deaths combined with panel regressions to estimate the impact of FDI on workplace safety. There are two main findings so far. First, workplace injuries in the US have generally trended downwards over time as FDI has increased. Second, FDI tends to flow into industries with better workplace safety outcomes. Future work will look at heterogeneity by state and source country workplace safety."
