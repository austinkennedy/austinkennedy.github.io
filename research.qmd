<summary>Abstract</summary>

*This paper examines fiscal policy spillovers through informal international financial channels, using the US stimulus checks as a positive, sudden, and direct fiscal shock. I utilize granular, transaction-level cryptocurrency data combined with an algorithm to probabilistically identify cross-border “crypto vehicle” transactions to construct bilateral cryptocurrency flows between countries. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, I compare cryptocurrency outflows between the US and other high-income countries and find that cryptocurrency outflows from the US increased to middle- and high-income countries by 17% and 16%, respectively, in response to the stimulus. This provides the first evidence of fiscal spillovers operating through informal remittance channels.*

<summary>Abstract</summary>

*Using textual analysis of 173,031 works printed in England between 1500 and 1900, we test whether British culture evolved to manifest a heightened belief in progress associated with science and industry. Our analysis yields three main findings. First, there was a separation in the language of science and religion beginning in the 17th century. Second, scientific volumes became more progress-oriented during the Enlightenment. Third, industrial works, especially those at the science-political economy nexus, were more progress-oriented beginning in the 17th century. It was therefore the more pragmatic, industrial works which reflected the cultural values cited as important for Britain's takeoff.*

* [**Does Business Culture Travel? The Case of Worker Safety.**](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4815767)

<summary>Abstract</summary>

*This paper examines the effect of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) into the United States on workplace safety outcomes. I combine data on workplace injuries in the US with FDI flows by industry. Using panel regressions, I find evidence of two competing effects of FDI: one that increases competition in an industry, leading to worse workplace safety outcomes, and one that promotes positive spillovers between foreign-owned and domestic firms, improving workplace safety outcomes. I do not find any evidence that the effect of FDI on workplace safety depends on the source of FDI.*
