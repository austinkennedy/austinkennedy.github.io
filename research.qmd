<summary>Abstract</summary>

*This paper examines fiscal policy spillovers through informal international financial channels, using the US stimulus checks as a positive, sudden, and direct fiscal shock. I utilize granular, transaction-level cryptocurrency data combined with an algorithm to probabilistically identify cross-border â€œcrypto vehicle" transactions to construct bilateral cryptocurrency flows between countries. Using a difference-in-differences strategy, I compare cryptocurrency outflows between the US and other high-income countries and find a sharp but temporary increase in cryptocurrency outflows as a result of the direct stimulus. I quantify the fiscal spillover relative to expenditure and place an upper bound of 2.52% through this channel. This implies that fiscal spillovers through remittance channels are likely modest in size.*

<summary>Abstract</summary>

*We trace the evolution of the language of science, religion, and political economy in the centuries leading to the British Industrial Revolution. Using textual analysis of 264,443 works printed in England between 1500 and 1900, we test whether British culture manifested a belief in progress associated with science and industry. Our analysis yields three main findings. First, there was a separation in the languages of science and religion beginning in the mid-18th century. Second, volumes using language at the nexus of science and political economy became more progress-oriented during the Enlightenment. Third, volumes using industrial language-especially those at the science-political economy nexus-were more progress-oriented beginning in the 18th century.*

<summary>Abstract</summary>

*This paper examines the effect of inward foreign direct investment (FDI) into the United States on workplace safety outcomes. I combine data on workplace injuries in the US with FDI flows by industry. Using panel regressions, I find evidence of two competing effects of FDI: one that increases competition in an industry, leading to worse workplace safety outcomes, and one that promotes positive spillovers between foreign-owned and domestic firms, improving workplace safety outcomes. I do not find any evidence that the effect of FDI on workplace safety depends on the source of FDI.*
